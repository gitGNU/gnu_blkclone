The data stream for an image is simply a run of blocks containing data.

The associated index provides the mapping to blocks on the physical device.

The minimum block size for a v1 data stream is 64 bytes.

All structures within a stream are block-aligned.  The block size is read
from the index.

The first block contains a header instead of data:

    CHAR[16]	"BLKCLONEDATA\r\n\004\000"
		  (The string "BLKCLONEDATA" followed by
		   ASCII CR, LF, EOT, and NUL.)
    UINT8[16]	UUID for this image;
		 used to ensure that the correct index is used
    UINT8	version number; 1 for v1 data format


The rest of the header block is padded with zero out to the block size
listed in the index.  Note that entire blocks are read at once, so using a
very large block size will cause problems.

The UUID is stored as a sequence of bytes in the same order as the UUID is
written, ignoring the hyphens.  (This avoids portability issues.)

After the header, data blocks are recorded literally in the order in which
the index refers to their contents.  A partial block is stored at the
beginning of its "slot" in the image stream and padded out to the block
size with zero.
