README for block device fast clone tool
=======================================

The blkclone toolkit enables efficient imaging of filesystems under Linux.

These tools support block-level imaging of FAT (TODO) and NTFS (TODO)
filesystems and a heuristic method of constructing block-level images that
simply omits all blocks containing only zero from the image data.

(Heuristic images can only be restored using "nuke and pave" method that
writes zeroes to all unused blocks.  Zeroing unused space is optional for
other block-level images.)
[[TODO: implement heuristic imaging]]

Additionally, for filesystems which Linux fully supports, these tools use
cpio(1) to perform file-level imaging.  Restoring a cpio-based image to a
blank disk requires restoring partitions, running the appropriate mkfs(8),
then mounting the new filesystem and unpacking the cpio archive into place.
[[TODO: implement file-level imaging]]

Each partition image consists of an index file and a data file.  Since
these files are accessed sequentially, they may be filtered through
external compression tools.

Disk partitions are handled separately; a full disk image has an additional
index file (listing partitions) and an optional block-level image for
non-partitioned space.
