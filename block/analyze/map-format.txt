A block list is one of the allowed types of index files; it is in plain text.

A block list begins with a version signature line:

    BLKCLONE BLOCK LIST V1

The signature is followed by several key-value pairs of the form "Key: Value".

The keys required for a V1 block list are:

    UUID:	  A UUID for this image; used to bind index and data.
    Type:	  The name of the module that produced this extent map.
    BlockSize:	  The number of bytes in a block.
    BlockCount:	  The total number of blocks in the data.

The optional keys currently defined are:

    FsType:	  The filesystem type, if the module handles multiple types

After the metadata keys, a marker line introduces the list of extents:

    BEGIN BLOCK LIST

Each extent is stored as "<starting block number>+<length of run in blocks>".
Only the areas that contain data are listed.

The end of the list has a corresponding marker line:

    END BLOCK LIST
